# AN Extra Nodes

It is an extension for the [Animation Nodes](https://github.com/JacquesLucke/animation_nodes) add-on.
Therefore, if you have installed the Animation Nodes, then you can use this add-on. It is still under the
development phase, so it has fewer new nodes from the [Extra Nodes](https://github.com/3DSinghVFX/animation_nodes).

Download the latest version from the [release page](https://github.com/3DSinghVFX/an_extra_nodes/releases).
